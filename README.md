Project Title
Customer Behavior Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Online Shopping

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyse customer purchasing behavior in an online retail environment and extract actionable insights that support marketing, personalization, and revenue-driven business decisions. Building on extensive data cleaning, data visualisation, and predictive modeling, will explore how user characteristics, session activity, and product interactions relate to purchase probability and spending outcomes.

The project results include:

A fully cleaned and structured dataset suitable for modeling.
Visual insights into customer behavior, value segments, and purchase drivers.
Predictive models capable of estimating purchase probability and spending levels.
Actionable patterns for marketing, such as product bundles, segment-specific strategies, and personalized targeting.
